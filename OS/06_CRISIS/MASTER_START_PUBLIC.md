# ResilienceOS — Master Start (Public, Offline-First)
Goal: boot the system in <60 seconds and keep it usable with small context windows.

1) Double-click `OMEGA_ONE_CLICK.command`
2) Dashboard opens automatically (port is stored in `OS/logs/dashboard_server.port`)
3) Use **Copy NEW CHAT PACK** to start a new AI chat with consistent context

Safety:
- Evidence-first: never invent numbers
- Keep private data out of Git
